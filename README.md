# Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service) or not based on various features. This prediction can help businesses take proactive measures to retain customers.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features related to customer behavior and demographics. The target variable is whether the customer has churned or not.

## Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.
<br>
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the data to uncover patterns and insights.
<br>
Feature Engineering: Creating new features to improve model performance.
<br>
Model Training: Training various machine learning models to predict customer churn.
<br>
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
<br>
Prediction: Making predictions on new data.
